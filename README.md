This is a cryptocurrency project where you can get all the latest information in detail about all famous cryptocurrencies.
You can read and search most recent news related to almost all important cryptocurrencies.
I have used react-chartjs-2 so you can also see the price history of all important cryptocurrencies visually with the help of line chart for a variety of timelines.
In this project I have used React Redux Toolkit for state management and React Query for fetching the data from 2 APIs.


For fetching crypto related all the information like all the stats and price details including price history data for line chart I have used "Coinranking API" and for fetching
news related to all the cryptocurrencies I have used 'Bing News Search API'.

This project is just a MVP right now and I have listed a lot of features to add in this project.
I hope you will love this project.
