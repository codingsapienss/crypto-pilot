"This is a cryptocurrency project where you can find detailed information about all popular cryptocurrencies:

➤ Explore and search for the latest news related to almost all major cryptocurrencies.
➤ Utilizing react-charts-2, you can visually track the price history of significant cryptocurrencies through interactive line charts for various timelines.
➤ In this project, I've implemented React Redux Toolkit for state management and utilized React Query to fetch data from two APIs.
➤ To access crypto-related information, including statistics, price details, and price history data for the line charts, I've integrated the 'Coinranking API.' Additionally, for news related to all cryptocurrencies, I've integrated the 'Bing News Search API.'"
